The second smallest is 90. Let's re-read the original puzzle. The prompt asks to make the second largest NOT a supercell but the second smallest IS. Let's use 10, 20, 100. Arrangement: 10, 100, 20. Second largest is 20. It's next to 100, so it's not a supercell. Second smallest is 20. Its neighbor is 100, which is larger, so it is also not a supercell. Let's try 100, 10, 20. 20 is a supercell (neighbor is 10). So in this case, the second largest IS a supercell. The question implies a complex arrangement is needed. Let's re-examine the book's logic. Fill a table such that the cell having the second largest number is not a supercell but the second smallest number is a supercell. Consider 4 numbers: 10, 20, 90, 100. Arrange as 100, 90, 10, 20. Second largest (90) is next to 100, not a supercell. Second smallest (20) is at the end next to 10, so it IS a supercell. This shows it is possible with the right arrangement.",
