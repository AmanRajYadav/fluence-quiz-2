        "Because of static electricity."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The movement is caused by the invisible magnetic force. Like poles repel, pushing the magnet on the pencils away, and unlike poles attract, pulling it closer.",

    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "You are given two identical-looking bars. One is a magnet, and one is a piece of iron. How can you identify the magnet using only these two bars?",
      "options": [
        "See which one is heavier.",
        "Bring an end of one bar to the middle of the other. If it attracts, it's the magnet.",
        "Bring the ends of the bars towards each other. The one that can repel the other is the magnet.",

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Attraction can happen between a magnet and iron, or two magnets. However, repulsion only happens between two magnets (like poles). Therefore, if you find a point of repulsion between the two bars, you have identified both as magnets. The definitive test is repulsion.",

        "It is a magnetic South pole.",
        "It has no magnetic polarity.",
        "It is constantly changing polarity."
      ],
      "correct": 1,

        "The like poles of magnet X and magnet Y are facing each other, causing repulsion.",
        "The magnets are stuck to the wooden rod."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The magnet X is held up by the force of magnetic repulsion. This occurs because the pole on the bottom of magnet X is the same as the pole on the top of magnet Y (e.g., North facing North).",

        "Cannot be determined."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "For the magnets to stick together as shown, unlike poles must be touching. The magnet with end 5 (North) must have a South pole at its other end. Therefore, end 4, which is touching that South pole, must be a North pole. The other end of that middle magnet would be South.",

        "Neutral",
        "Cannot be determined"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Following the logic: End 5 is N, so its other end is S. This attracts end 4, making end 4 an N pole. The other end of that middle magnet is S. This attracts the magnet with end 6, making its touching end an N pole. Therefore, the far end, end 6, must be a South pole.",
